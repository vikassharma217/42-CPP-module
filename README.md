CPP Modules

Welcome to the CPP Modules repository! This project showcases an exciting journey through C++ programming, developed as part of the 42 curriculum. Each module focuses on key C++ concepts, from basics to advanced topics, helping you grow as a programmer through hands-on exercises.

Modules Overview

CPP Module 00: Introduction to C++

  Basics of syntax, compilation, and namespaces.

  Writing simple programs and using Makefiles.

CPP Module 01: Memory Allocation and References

  Stack vs. heap memory, references, and basic memory management.

CPP Module 02: Polymorphism and Operator Overloading

  Operator overloading and ad-hoc polymorphism.

CPP Module 03: Inheritance

  Class hierarchies, abstract classes, and virtual functions.

CPP Module 04: Abstract Classes and Polymorphism

  Designing abstract classes and implementing dynamic memory management.

CPP Module 05: Exception Handling

  Writing resilient code with try, catch, and throw.

CPP Module 06: Casting

  Understanding static, dynamic, const, and reinterpret casts.

CPP Module 07: Templates

  Writing flexible class and function templates.

CPP Module 08: Templated Containers

  Designing STL-like containers and iterators.

CPP Module 09: Advanced Concepts

  Inter-module communication, std::move, and performance optimization.
